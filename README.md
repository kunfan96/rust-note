# RUST-NOTE

> 鲁迅说过：“好记性不如烂笔头，学东西也做好笔记”

开这个 PROJ 主要是为了给我那杂乱无章的 rust 知识做一份梳理，充当一份备忘录的功能。

感觉敲了这么久的代码，一直深陷在一个 LOOP。每次学一门东西很多时候都是半途而废，囫囵吞枣却洋洋得意，潇潇洒洒数载，虽然没有得到什么苦果，但是这种恶习绝不能留。

时代在变化，人们的思维/大环境/各种交错复杂的人事物在前进，可以预料到一场大变革正在来临，这时候自己如果没有做好准备，必然会被淘汰，车子/房子/妹子怎么办???

迎难而上，不怕困难，不怕失败，加油吧，自己。

> Lu Xun once said, "A good memory is no match for a lousy pen. Taking notes while learning is crucial."

The purpose of starting this project is to organize my messy knowledge of Rust, serving as a memo for myself.

After coding for so long, I realize that I have been trapped in a loop. Often, I would give up halfway through learning something, thinking I understood it when I didn't, and this bad habit cannot continue.

As times change, people's thinking, the environment, and all kinds of complicated human events are advancing. It can be predicted that a big change is coming, and if I am not prepared, I will undoubtedly be eliminated. What about my car, my house, and my girlfriend?

Let's face challenges, not afraid of difficulties or failures, and keep going. Come on, myself.
